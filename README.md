### INTRODUCTION
This repository contains code and resources for the detection of lung cancer using medical imaging data. Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide, making early detection crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes.

Detecting lung cancer through medical imaging, such as chest X-rays and CT scans, plays a vital role in diagnosis. With recent advancements in machine learning and image processing techniques, automated methods for lung cancer detection have shown promising results, aiding radiologists in accurate and timely diagnosis.

The goal of this project is to develop and implement algorithms capable of automatically identifying suspicious regions indicative of lung cancer in medical images. By leveraging machine learning models trained on labeled datasets, we aim to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of lung cancer detection, ultimately contributing to better patient care and outcomes.
